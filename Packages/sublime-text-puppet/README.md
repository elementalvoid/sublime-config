sublime-text-puppet
===================
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin to add support for Puppet syntax highlighting.
It's a fork from eklein's sublime-text-puppet which is a fork from 
arioch's sublime-text-puppet which is a fork from Brice Figureau's
puppet-textmate-bundle repository with a few changes to make it work in Sublime Text 2.

I do not wish to take any credit for his (and others') hard work.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------
Using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), add a 
repository using the URL in the form:
> https://github.com/ebratb/sublime-text-puppet

Donâ€™t include .git at the end!

Restart sublime and you should be good to go.  You can manually set
puppet syntax highlighting if it's necessary.
